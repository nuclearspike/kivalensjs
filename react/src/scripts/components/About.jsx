      <h3>What is KivaLens?</h3>
      <p>
        KivaLens is an alternative way to search for Kiva loans offering a lot of options that Kiva does not.
        After you've found your loans and put them in your KivaLens basket, you just click a button and the
        loans will be transferred to Kiva where you'll complete your purchase.

            <h3>What is Kiva?</h3>
            <p>
                Kiva is a non-profit that helps microfinance institutions (MFIs) around the world get access to 0%
                interest capital so that they can keep their overhead lower as they lend the money to
                borrowers who have very few options for access to capital. MFIs typically lend at
                interest to cover their operating expenses, if they weren't able to access the 0% capital from
                Kiva lenders, the MFIs may borrow from banks at 15% interest which is passed on to the borrower.
                A lot of the loans are very simple, a borrower owns a shop but they can't afford to stock their
                store with more products. A loan allows them to carry more products, leading to more customers
                and sales and they repay their loan. You lend $25 to borrowers and they repay over time
                (over 97% of the money loaned through Kiva of the money is repaid).

      <h3>Rebuilt and Rethought</h3>
      <p>
        KivaLens has been rebuilt. I decided to re-invent it using different tools
        that weren't available when KivaLens was first written with Silverlight.
        Please <EmailLink subject="KivaLens Features" title="Send a feature request">let me
        know</EmailLink> what else you'd like to be able to do. You can also join
        the <KivaLink path="team/kivalens?default_team=kivalens">KivaLens Lending Team</KivaLink> to discuss
        and get announcements.
      </p>

      <h3>Questions/Problems?</h3>
      <p>
        All of the data that KivaLens displays is either a direct presentation of or computation from data that
        is pulled from <NewTabLink href="http://build.kiva.org/api">Kiva.org's Public API</NewTabLink> with the
        exception of data from the Atheist Team's research. If you have any
        questions about why a loan is showing
        certain data (where you have confirmed that it's the same on Kiva's own site) or if you have questions
        about what that data means, please check out <KivaLink path="help" title="Go to Kiva Help Center">Kiva's
        Help Center or contact Kiva Customer Service</KivaLink>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you find a discrepancy between Kiva's site and what KivaLens displays for loans or partners or if
        you feel that a computation or filter is incorrect, or you find something unusual about how KivaLens is
        working
        then <EmailLink subject="KivaLens Bug"

          <b>Sorting/Filtering by Final Repayment Date vs Repayment Terms</b> While Kiva allows you to sort by
          repayment terms, there are a few issues with this method from the perspective of the lender.
          Since different loans have different dates on which they posted to Kiva and the disbursal dates
          can have wide-ranges as well, an "8 month" repayment term on a pre-disbursed loan that posted
          almost a month ago could already have repayments underway. While the same repayment terms on
          a <i>post</i>-disbursed loan that just posted today could end up with a final repayment
          date <i>months</i> different from the first loan mentioned. Yet Kiva will sort them side-by-side
          because they have the same "8 month" repayment terms. Since Kiva only allows you to sort by
          repayment terms but not filter by them, it still shows you all loans. KivaLens lets you remove
          loans that don't match your selection for final repayment. Also, KivaLens doesn't sort by the term
          for the borrower, but the final repayment date relative to today, erasing the issues created by
          pre/post disbursed loans and different post dates. In Kiva's system (and the API, so also
          KivaLens), all repayment dates are shown at the first of the month, while many/most partners will
          actually settle the payments on the 17th of the <i>prior</i> month. So, many times you'll actually
          get your repayments about 2 weeks <i>sooner</i> than what KivaLens displays, assuming the partners
          settle early (as is common) and the borrower and partner are not delinquent.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Better Sorts for Repayments!</b> You have the ability to sort by final repayment date (which is
          better than "repayment terms" sort on Kiva since it's from the lender perspective), but
          there's a new sort by when the loan is scheduled to repay -- by percentages. Let me explain.
          Let's say you have 3 loans, all with a final repayment date 3 months away. The new sort will
          prioritize which pays more sooner. So, let's say loan #1 has a equal amount you get back each
          month. #2 has a larger amount on the first repayment then by the final it's very little and #3
          only has one single repayment at the very end. The new sorts will prioritize by how quickly you get
          50%, then 75% then 100% back. So for the loans above, #2 would be the first, then #1, then #3.
          With pre-disbursed loans that start paying back right away, the first repayment to the lender can
          actually be a combination of multiple repayments made by the borrower. Using this sort will help
          find the loans that will allow the quickest turnaround for your money, if that's your goal.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Any/All/None Filtering</b> What is the difference between "Any" and "All"? "All" is only available
          for properties of a loan where it can have multiple. So, a loan can only have one country, but
          it can have multiple tags so there won't be an "All" option for Country since a loan couldn't be
          in multiple countries and you'd get no results. If you select "All" for tags, then the loan must have
          &nbsp;<i>all</i> listed tags. If you select "Any" for Tags, then the loan has to match <i>at least
          one</i>&nbsp;
          of your selection. "None" allows you to exclude results, so if you are opposed to "Liquor Store
          / Off-License," "Balut-Making" and other controversial activities, you can exclude them.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Auto-complete drop-downs</b> for Sector, Activity, Country, Region, Social Performance Badges,
          Themes, Tags, Partners, etc. KivaLens will also show you graphs along the side (when on a large enough
          device) indicating what options you have for that criteria so you don't have to guess at what
          will narrow your options for you.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>A Ton of Filters Kiva doesn't have</b> including "Loans at Risk %" and "Currency Loss %"
          for partners to further reduce your risk. Repayment interval filtering so you can find only
          loans paying back monthly, granular currency loss coverage options, mentioned ages, specific
          percentage of genders in a group, $/hour, expiring in days, disbursal days, average loan per
          capita income, years the partner has been on kiva and how many loans they've posted.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Bulk Add!</b> This is a favorite feature for previous KivaLens users and what I heard about
          the most from mega-lenders that they missed after the previous version of KivaLens bit the
          dust in July of 2015. Add tons of loans that match your criteria to your basket all at once!
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Mobile!</b> Since the new site is just HTML and Javascript rather than Silverlight, it
          will run on everything and it's designed to automatically adapt to the size of the device
          you're using, so if you're on a phone, it will hide the graphs, and stack everything into
          one column; on a tablet, it displays differently depending on its orientation and
          laptop/desktop users have the easiest experience taking advantage of the width to show you more.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>See graphs!</b> View graphs that show the distribution of the current filter.
          Ex: Select "Retail" as your Sector filter, and by clicking into the Country box, you can see how Retail loans
          are spread across
          Countries and what Activities are available by clicking into those drop-downs to make the
          graphs down the side appear (only on large displays).
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Live Filtering = Speed!</b> Since it downloads all of the loans at the start and then
          filters them in your browser, you get "as-you-type" filtering. Drag a slider around,
          pause for a second and watch your results change right then, it doesn't have to talk to the server.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Always Fresh!</b> KivaLens listens to the same live data-stream
          that <KivaLink path='live?v=1'>Kiva /Live</KivaLink> uses. That means that the very second a new
          loan posts, a loan gets funded or any lending activity happens on Kiva, the loans loaded in your
          browser are kept exactly up-to-date without needing to reload the page. You may see a loan turn
          gray in the results indicating it either expired or funded or if you keep a popular loan open,
          the page will automatically update as more lenders lend money.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Hide Loans you've already loaned to</b> so that you don't accidentally lend to them more
          than you want. To use this, go to "Options" to input your kiva lender-id. From the Criteria
          "Portfolio" tab and select the appropriate option.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Saved Searches</b> Save your favorite searches to quickly jump back to them. The site
          will start you out with some default saved searches to give you an idea of how to use them.
          As you view loan details, the "Saved Searches" line will show you which Saved Searches have
          that loan in their results. Saved Searches are stored with your browser, so if you clear
          you browser settings, you'll lose your Saved Searches. Also, Save Searches are not shared
          across devices (you set up a Saved Search on your laptop, it won't show on your phone).
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Filter on the Atheist Team's MFI research</b> with sliders for Secular and Social scoring.
          When you click on a loan, the Partner tab will show a new section displaying data pulled from
          that team's spreadsheet. This feature is on by default, simply turn it off in the Options tab.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Portfolio Balancing</b> Whether you're a "Country Collector," or maybe that you don't
          want to have too many active loans from only a few partners, or if you want to find more
          sectors like your favorites, use the Portfolio Balancing tools to help you accomplish
          your lending goals.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>3D Loan Wall</b> When you have your lender id entered you can view a 3D "wall" of images
          of the borrowers in your portfolio.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Auto-Lending Preferences</b> Kiva has had <KivaLink path="settings/credit">Auto-Lending</KivaLink> for
          years but the options are a bit anemic. Since browser extensions have far more permissions than
          a web page does, KivaLens is able to tell the extension to alter your auto-lending settings on Kiva.
          KivaLens offers extensive partner criteria as well as portfolio balancing for Sector, Country and
          Activity. When you use KivaLens in conjunction with <KLALink/> you can easily set your auto-lending
          preferences and take full advantage of Kiva's feature.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Notifications</b> When you have the <KLALink/> installed, you can set your Saved Searches to play
          a sound if a new loan is added. There are some types of loans (especially the ultra-short term
          loans) that can fully fund within less than a 1-2 hours. Install the extension, set your criteria,
          select that you want to be notified on the menu option on the Saved Search menu, leave KivaLens
          open and you won't even have to have the browser showing and KivaLens will tell the extension
          to display a notification visible outside of the browser and play a sound. The loan must be posted
          with all criteria matching or the notification won't fire. So, a notification set up with
          restrictions for funding amounts that don't include 0 would never fire. Tags on loans are added
          by other users after the loan has already posted, so any criteria with Tags won't fire. Filters
          with expiration, $/hour or details that change after the loan posts will also not ever get a
          notification.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Compare Teams</b> On the "Teams" page, you can compare the membership count, loan count, and total
          amount loaned for your teams.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>RSS Feeds</b> Once your criteria is set, you can go to the "RSS" tab and it will give you a URL
          that you can paste into your favorite RSS reader or use a site
          like <NewTabLink href="http://www.ifttt.com">IFTTT (If This Then That)</NewTabLink> that will watch for
          new items in the feed and you can create a "Recipe" where you can set it to email, text/SMS,
          instant message, or many more things like change the colors or lights in your room (if you're using
          Philips Hue lights).
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h3>Reducing Risk</h3>
      <p>
        None of this guarantees you anything. Use your own discretion, research, thoughts, team
        message boards, exchanges with Kiva's Customer Service, etc to help inform your lending habits.
      </p>
      <ul className='spacedList'>
        <li>
          <b>Institutional Risk:</b> The "Risk Rating" for a partner is based on Kiva's assessment on how
          likely it is that a partner will fail (institutional default) based on a huge formula as well
          as some good old-fashioned gut feelings. Example: Some MFIs are running their business from
          a spreadsheet while others have a comprehensive software package (MIS). There are many things
          that together give an indication of how sustainable they are over time.
          The higher the star rating, the less likely it is for the partner to fail.
          This is not any indication on whether or not the borrower is risky and is no guarantee.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Currency Exchange Risk:</b> Even if a borrower pays back in full, if they are paying back in a
          currency
          other than USD, there is a risk that you can lose some money due to the exchange rate. Using the
          Currency Exchange Loss % Partner slider, you can use history as an indicator of the future for
          how much you may lose (but there's no guarantee). Some partners cover more of the currency loss
          than others. There's also a drop-down for "Currency Loss" that allows you to exclude loans where
          loss is possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Default Rates:</b> All partners will have defaults, some partners choose to cover the losses of
          defaulted
          borrowers in order to pay back Kiva lenders as a part of doing business. Choosing partners with 0%
          default means you are most likely choosing a partner that is covering losses, which if you have
          large amounts of money in, may be exactly what you're looking for.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Portfolio Yield:</b> Reducing organizations down to a number and then making assumptions based
          off
          that number can actually unintentionally exclude the very partners you would actually most like
          if you knew more about them. One of the most significant learnings I had when I worked at Kiva was
          regarding Portfolio Yield. PY values are based on costs charged to the borrower over the amount
          of the loan. So, consider this... a partner that specializes in rural loans to agricultural
          borrowers where the expense to the partner to service the loan (travelling hours to collect
          weekly/monthly from one or only a few borrowers) is actually quite high and the loan amount is low,
          it will have a higher PY% relative to a more urban partner that only does high value loans where
          their cost to service the loan is very low since the borrowers come in to their office. So,
          don't judge high PY values too harshly or you may just be excluding partners that are servicing
          the most needy borrowers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Profitability:</b> When I initially wrote KivaLens (prior to working at Kiva), I incorrectly
          assumed that a partner with a negative profitability naturally meant they were at greater risk for
          institutional collapse and thus cause all outstanding loans to fail. While this is not only a
          logical conclusion, it is also stated as a risk for negative profitability on Kiva's site.
          However, this is not always the case. There are a number of partners that receive money from
          outside sources where this money is not factored in when calculating their profitability.
          So, just because your borrower is getting a loan from a partner that has a large negative profit,
          they're not necessarily more likely to collapse; it's not that simple.
          However, if the partner is not receiving money from outside sources and are operating a loss
          for extended periods, they may be at higher risk of institutional default. Since there is no
          way to tell which MFIs are or are not receiving money from outside sources, the "safest"
          bet is to choose partners with positive profitability. But hopefully this answers any questions
          where you watch a partner operate at large losses for years but remain afloat.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Group Loans:</b> Due to the high variability with how group loans are organized by partner, you
          cannot necessarily make assumptions about group loans versus individual. Some partners group riskier
          borrowers together so they can prove themselves and graduate to individual loans and the grouping
          is arbitrary just to make repayment collections simpler to lower the cost of servicing the loan.
          Some groups are "solidarity" groups where group members have committed to pay for individuals who
          default. While you can search for "solidarity" in the name field to find some "safer" loans,
          most solidarity loans do not have that in their name and there is no way to tell from the
          loan data to help you find more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Repeat Borrowers:</b> A borrower coming back for a second or third loan does NOT mean
          they are more risky. In fact, it usually means the opposite. If a borrower has completed a loan
          successfully and the partner has chosen to give them another loan, then many times that means
          they are more likely to repay. Repeat borrowing does not necessarily mean they are in a cycle
          of debt, but instead that they've shown that their previous loan was successful in improving
          their business that another (usually larger) loan can help them to continue to grow their business.
          Use the #RepeatBorrower tag search to help find them.

          KivaLens user (<LenderLink lender='thomas85717133'>Thomas</LenderLink>) has
          used Kiva's <NewTabLink href="http://build.kiva.org/docs/data/snapshots">data
          snapshots</NewTabLink> and compared repayment rates for ended loans tagged #FirstLoan vs
          #RepeatBorrower and found loans tagged with #RepeatBorrower had a repayment rate of
          99.16% vs loans tagged with #FirstLoan of 98.55% (using data current as of Dec 8, 2015).

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Diversify!</b> When searching for loans, your criteria may keep bringing up loans from the same
          partners
          over and over again. Having too much money with only a handful of partners means that if those partners have
          institutional default, you could lose all of your outstanding balance. Diversity among countries
          can also be beneficial because it protects you from your portfolio being as impacted by natural
          disasters, wars, etc. Use KivaLens' Portfolio Balancing Criteria options (on Portfolio tab)
          to do this for you. After you set your Lender ID on the Options page, go back to Search and
          there's a pre-set Saved Search of "Balance Partner Risk" which sets the Portfolio Balancing options
          to hide loans from any partner where they have > 0% of your active portfolio. If you have a lot
          of active loans, you may need to increase the percentage to allow for more per partner. Also use the
          "Limit to top" option to only show 1 loan (or a couple if you're doing large volume) per Partner.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Something to consider:</b> Ultimately, you shouldn't be considering Kiva as a "bank" (which is
          why I
          changed the name from kivabank to kivalens years ago). Over time, even the most cautious lenders
          are very likely to lose money to default or currency exchange unless you are extremely lucky.
          You should lend with the expectation of some loss and be happy when everything goes perfectly.
          You are lending to help people, not for any return on your money (obviously) or even with any
          assumptions of total repayment. Happy lending!

      <h3>Open-source</h3>
      <p>
        Kiva Lens is now open-source, so feel free to <EmailLink subject="KivaLens Developer">email
        me</EmailLink> about
        working on it. It uses React, Reflux, react-bootstrap, gulp,
        browserify, node, ES6, babel (JSX, ES6 transpiler), Kiva API, linqjs, Highcharts, express node js server
        and more. You can check out the source code (in progress)
        at my <NewTabLink href="https://github.com/nuclearspike/kivalensjs/tree/master/react">github
        repository</NewTabLink>.

      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        KivaLens was initially created in 2009 (as a Silverlight app) because I wanted to find loans
        in ways and Kiva did not offer the filter/sorts I wanted. I ended up working at Kiva for a few years
        and helped incorporate a lot of the search features directly into Kiva's site which also then made
        their way into the API as well. There are still some great things KivaLens does that Kiva does not
        do that are handy and fun! Some projects I worked on at Kiva: Super Graphs for lenders and teams,
        /Live, Zip, Leader boards, Message board search with time-line, the Home page (at the time),
        and Estimated Repayments are some of the ones I enjoyed the most, many of which were
        "Innovation Iteration" projects where engineers implement their own ideas.

      <h3>Kiva Lender Assistant (KLA) Chrome Extension</h3>
      <p>
        There's also a Google Chrome browser extension I wrote that inserts repayment graph (sparklines)
        on the Lend tab along with other repayment info, talks to you about things it notices about the loan,
        details about lenders and teams you hover over, etc. There are also a number of features that KivaLens
        has that require KLA to work. <KLALink>Check out screenshots, a detailed description and
        install Kiva Lender Assistant here</KLALink> or&nbsp;

        <If condition={KLAVersion}>
                    <span>
                        You have KLA version {KLAVersion} installed. Chrome does a good job
                        of keeping your extensions up to date automatically, but to check for upgrades manually,
                        go to Chrome's "Window" menu, select "Extensions" and switch on "Developer Mode"
                        then click the button to update your extensions.
                    </span>
