 * Pass in an array of ids, it will break the array into 100 max chunks (kiva restriction) fetch them all, then returns
 * them together (very possible that they'll get out of order if more than one page; if order is important then order
 * the results yourself using a linqjs join against the original array request. this could be made more generic where
 * it doesn't know they are loans if needed in the future)

 * Example use:
 *
 * var loans = new LoanBatch([1000,2000])
 * loans.start().done(results => console.log(results))
