 * The Redis warm-start cache is explicitly "purely additive and never fatal":
 * with no REDISCLOUD_URL (local dev) or with Redis down, every entry point must
 * quietly no-op so the server still boots and serves. These run with no Redis
 * configured, which is exactly that path — if any of them threw, a Redis outage
 * would take the whole server down with it.
