/**
 * Kiva's fundraising listing is LIVE: loans fund out and new ones post while the
 * server is paging through it. Because paging is offset-based, a shift between
 * page N and N+1 can either
 *   - push a loan back across the boundary  -> it is returned TWICE, or
 *   - pull a loan forward across it        -> it is MISSED entirely.
 *
 * The client trusts server batches (setKivaLoans(..., trustNoDupes=true)), so
 * anything the server emits is shown as-is. That makes de-duplication the
 * SERVER's job, and makes a missed loan self-healing: the next refresh re-pulls
 * the whole listing and picks it up.
